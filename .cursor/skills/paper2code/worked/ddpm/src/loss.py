"""
Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models — Training Objective (Simplified Loss)

Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239
Authors: Ho, Jain, Abbeel (2020)

Implements: L_simple from §3.4, Eq. 14

"We have shown that the variational bound... can be optimized with a
 simplified objective... which resembles denoising score matching..."

  L_simple = E_{t, x_0, ε} [ ||ε − ε_θ(√ᾱ_t x_0 + √(1−ᾱ_t) ε, t)||² ]

This is MSE between the true noise ε and the model's prediction ε_θ.
The expectation is over:
  - t ~ Uniform({1, ..., T})
  - x_0 ~ q(x_0)  (data distribution)
  - ε ~ N(0, I)

§3.4 — "We found it beneficial to sample quality (and simpler to implement)
to train on the following variant of the variational bound... L_simple"

§3.4 — "Algorithm 1" describes the training procedure that uses this loss.

    This module handles only the loss computation. The caller (training loop)
    is responsible for sampling t, computing x_t from x_0, and calling the model.
