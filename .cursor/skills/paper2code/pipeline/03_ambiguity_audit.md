# Stage 3: The Ambiguity Audit

## Purpose
This is the most important anti-hallucination stage. Before generating a single line of code, systematically audit every implementation-relevant detail and classify it as SPECIFIED, PARTIALLY_SPECIFIED, or UNSPECIFIED. This stage produces the raw material for `REPRODUCTION_NOTES.md`.

## Input
- Parsed paper sections from Stage 1
- Contribution analysis from Stage 2 (includes official code status)
- Official code repository (if found in Stage 1 — URL in `paper_metadata.json` under `official_code`)

## Output
- `.paper2code_work/{ARXIV_ID}/ambiguity_audit.md` — complete audit with classification for every item

---

## Critical mindset

**Assume nothing. Verify everything.**

When you read "we use standard settings," ask: standard according to whom? When you read "following prior work," ask: which prior work, and which specific detail from that work? When something seems obvious, ask: is it obvious because it's specified, or because you're making an assumption?

The goal of this stage is to produce a document where a researcher can look at any implementation choice and immediately know whether the paper specified it or whether you chose it.

## Reasoning protocol

### The complete checklist

Go through every item below. For each one, search the paper (method section, experiments section, appendix, footnotes — all of them) and classify:

- **SPECIFIED**: The paper states this explicitly. Record the exact quote and section.
- **PARTIALLY_SPECIFIED**: The paper mentions this but is ambiguous. Record the quote and what's unclear.
- **UNSPECIFIED**: The paper does not state this at all. Record common choices and which one you'll use as default.

### Architecture details

| Item | What to look for | Common hiding spots |
|------|------------------|---------------------|

|------|------------------|---------------------|
| Dataset name and version | Exact dataset identifier | Experiments section |
| Preprocessing steps | Tokenization, normalization, resizing | Appendix, experiments |
| Data augmentation | Random crop, flip, color jitter, etc. | Appendix or buried in experiments |
| Train/val/test split | Standard or custom? | Usually standard but verify |

| Evaluation frequency | Every N steps? Every epoch? | Appendix |
| Test-time augmentation | Averaging over crops/flips? | Experiments or appendix |
| Reported numbers | What Table 1 / main results show | Results section — record these for validation |

### How to search the paper

For each item in the checklist:

1. **Search the Method section** — the obvious place
2. **Search the Experiments section** — often contains "Implementation Details" or "Training Details" subsection
3. **Search the Appendix** — THE most common hiding spot for training details
4. **Search figure captions** — sometimes specify architectural details not in text
5. **Search footnotes** — authors sometimes put caveats and clarifications in footnotes
6. **Search the table captions** — hyperparameter tables often have footnotes with additional info
7. **Search for the specific term** — Ctrl+F the paper text for "learning rate," "dropout," "optimizer," etc.

### How to handle "following X" references

When the paper says "following [X]" or "similar to [X]" or "as in [X]":

1. Note the reference — what is paper X?
2. If X is a well-known paper (e.g., "following Vaswani et al."), describe what X specifies
3. If X is an obscure paper, flag this as requiring the reader to look up that paper
4. Record: `[PARTIALLY_SPECIFIED] Paper says "following [X]" for {component} — X specifies {detail} but reader should verify`

### How to resolve ambiguities using official code

If official code was found in Stage 1, use it as a primary resource for resolving `UNSPECIFIED` and `PARTIALLY_SPECIFIED` items. This is the single most effective way to reduce ambiguity.

**Process:**
1. For each `UNSPECIFIED` item, search the official repo for the relevant implementation detail (e.g., grep for "eps", "dropout", "lr" in config files and model code).
2. If you find the answer, change the classification:
   - `UNSPECIFIED` → `SPECIFIED` with tag `[FROM_OFFICIAL_CODE]`
   - `PARTIALLY_SPECIFIED` → `SPECIFIED` with tag `[FROM_OFFICIAL_CODE]`
3. Record the exact file and line from the official repo: `github.com/author/repo/blob/main/model.py#L42`

**What official code can resolve:**
- Activation functions, normalization epsilon, dropout placement
- Initialization schemes (often the biggest silent assumption)
- Learning rate schedule details, optimizer parameters
- Data preprocessing steps
- Any "standard settings" or "following prior work" references

**What official code cannot resolve:**
- Whether the code matches the paper's intent (bugs exist in official code too)
- Whether a detail was chosen for the paper's experiments vs. for engineering convenience

**Important:** Official code is a reference, not ground truth. If the official code contradicts the paper, note both and flag the discrepancy. See the errata section below.

---

### How to handle errata and contradictions

1. **Figure vs text disagreement**: Flag it explicitly. Implement what the text/equations say (they're usually more carefully reviewed than figures) but note the figure shows something different.

2. **Abstract vs method section disagreement**: Method section wins. The abstract is a summary and may oversimplify.

3. **Equation vs prose disagreement**: Equation wins. It's more precise. Flag the discrepancy.

4. **Paper vs official code disagreement**: Note both. The official code may fix bugs or reflect a later understanding, but the paper is what was peer-reviewed. Record: `Paper says X in §Y.Z, but official code does W — we implement {your choice} because {reason}`
