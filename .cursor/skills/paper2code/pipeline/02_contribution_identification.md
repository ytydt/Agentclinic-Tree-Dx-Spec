# Stage 2: Contribution Identification

## Purpose
Before writing any code, you must understand exactly what this paper contributes and what "implementing this paper" means. This stage forces clarity. 

## Input
- Parsed paper sections from Stage 1
- `paper_metadata.json` (includes `official_code` links if any were found)

## Output
- `.paper2code_work/{ARXIV_ID}/contribution.md` — contains the contribution statement, paper classification, and implementation scope

---

## Reasoning protocol

### Step 1: Read the abstract and introduction 

First read: understand what the paper claims to do.
Second read: identify the **single sentence** that states the core contribution. This is usually in the abstract ("We propose...," "We introduce...," "In this work, we...") or the last paragraph of the introduction ("Our contributions are...").

Tasks:
- What is the ONE thing this paper does that didn't exist before?
- If I had to explain this paper in 10 seconds to an ML engineer, what would I say?
- What would be missing from ML if this paper didn't exist?

Write this down as a one-sentence contribution statement.

### Step 2: Classify the paper type

Determine which category best fits. This directly affects what you implement:

#### (a) New architecture
**Examples:** Transformer, ResNet, Vision Transformer, U-Net
**What "implementing the core contribution" means:** The model architecture — layer definitions, forward pass, how components connect. The architecture IS the contribution.
**Priority sections:** Model/Architecture section, Figure showing the architecture, any Algorithm boxes
**What's secondary:** Training procedure (use standard), specific dataset preprocessing

#### (b) New training method or loss function
**Examples:** DDPM, SimCLR, RLHF, DPO
**What "implementing the core contribution" means:** The training loop, the loss function, the optimization procedure. The model architecture is usually borrowed from existing work.
**Priority sections:** Training/Objective section, loss function equations, Algorithm boxes describing the training procedure
**What's secondary:** Model architecture (often standard), dataset specifics

#### (c) New inference or generation technique
**Examples:** Beam search variants, nucleus sampling, classifier-free guidance
**What "implementing the core contribution" means:** The inference algorithm. There may be no training at all.
**Priority sections:** Inference/Generation section, Algorithm boxes, any sampling or decoding procedures
**What's secondary:** Training (none or standard), model architecture (usually pre-existing)

#### (d) New dataset or benchmark
**Examples:** ImageNet, GLUE, MMLU
**What "implementing the core contribution" means:** The evaluation framework, metrics, data loading pipeline. There may be baseline models but they're not the contribution.
**Priority sections:** Dataset description, evaluation methodology, metric definitions
**What's secondary:** Baseline model architectures (reference only)

#### (e) Theoretical analysis with empirical validation
**Examples:** Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, Scaling Laws
**What "implementing the core contribution" means:** The experimental setup that validates the theory. Often involves running specific experiments with specific measurements.
**Priority sections:** Experimental setup, what is measured and how, specific procedures
**What's secondary:** The theory proofs (important to understand but not to implement)

#### (f) System or engineering paper
**Examples:** Megatron-LM, FlashAttention, vLLM
**What "implementing the core contribution" means:** The system design — often involves low-level optimizations, custom kernels, or infrastructure.
**Priority sections:** System design section, performance benchmarks, implementation details
**Note:** These papers often cannot be reproduced in a minimal implementation because the contribution IS the engineering. Flag this honestly.

### Step 3: Find the Algorithm box

Search the paper for formal algorithm descriptions (usually labeled "Algorithm 1," "Algorithm 2," etc.). These are gold:

- They are the most precise specification of the procedure
- They resolve ambiguities in prose descriptions
- They define variable names and control flow explicitly
- If the prose says one thing and the Algorithm box says another, **implement the Algorithm box** and flag the discrepancy

If there is no Algorithm box, note this — it means the implementation will rely more on equations and prose, which are more ambiguous.

### Step 4: Check for official code

Check `paper_metadata.json` for the `official_code` field. If official code repositories were found in Stage 1:

1. **Verify the link** — open the URL. Confirm it's the authors' code for this paper, not an unrelated project or empty placeholder.
2. **Note the framework** — is it PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow? This may inform your implementation.
3. **Note the repo structure** — what files exist? This helps you understand the implementation scope.
4. **Do NOT read the code in detail yet** — that happens in Stage 3 when resolving ambiguities. At this stage, you just need to know it exists and what it covers.

Record the official code status in the contribution statement (Step 5).

### Step 5: Identify what to implement vs. reference

Make three lists:

**IMPLEMENT** (we will write this code):
- The core contribution (as identified in Step 2)
- Any component described in enough detail to implement from the paper alone

**REFERENCE** (we will import or note as dependency):
- Standard components the paper uses but didn't invent (e.g., "standard transformer encoder")
- Pre-trained models used as backbones
- Existing techniques referenced with "following [X]" or "similar to [X]"

**OUT OF SCOPE** (we will not touch):
- Baselines and comparison methods
- Ablation variants (unless the user specifically requests full mode)
- Dataset collection or annotation procedures
- Deployment-specific optimizations

### Step 6: Write the contribution statement

Write a structured contribution statement and save it to `contribution.md`:

```markdown
# Contribution Analysis

## Paper
{title} ({year})
{authors}
arxiv: {id}

## One-sentence summary
{what this paper does in one sentence}

## Paper type
{(a)-(f) classification with justification}

## Core contribution to implement
{One paragraph describing exactly what we will implement, referencing specific paper sections}

## Algorithm specification
{Whether an Algorithm box exists, and if so, which one is the primary specification}

## Official code
{URL if found, or "None found"}
{Framework used in official code, if applicable}
{Brief note on what the official repo covers}

## Implementation scope
### Will implement:
- {item 1 — with paper section reference}
- {item 2 — with paper section reference}

### Will reference (not reimplement):
- {item 1 — what it is, where to get it}

### Out of scope:
- {item 1 — why}

## Key sections for implementation
1. {Section X.Y — what it specifies}
2. {Section X.Y — what it specifies}
3. {Appendix A — what it specifies}
```

### Step 7: Self-check

Before proceeding:
- Could a competent ML engineer read my contribution statement and know exactly what to build? If not, it's too vague.
- Have I identified the paper type correctly? Read the abstract one more time.
- Have I checked the appendices for additional specification of the core contribution?
- Is there anything in my "IMPLEMENT" list that the paper doesn't actually describe in enough detail? Move it to "REFERENCE" or flag it.

## Common mistakes at this stage

1. **Trying to implement everything.** A paper about a new loss function doesn't need you to reimplement the backbone architecture. Import it.

2. **Misidentifying the contribution.** A paper might describe a new architecture but the actual contribution is the training recipe. Read what the authors claim, not what takes up the most pages.

3. **Ignoring paper type effects on scope.** The same checklist item (e.g., "training loop") can be in-scope or out-of-scope depending on the paper type. A training method paper MUST include the training loop. An architecture paper doesn't need more than a minimal example.

4. **Skipping the Algorithm box.** If Algorithm 1 exists and you don't read it carefully, you will implement based on noisy prose instead of the precise specification.

5. **Ignoring official code.** Stage 1 automatically searches for code links, but you must verify them in Step 4. If official code exists and you skip it, you'll waste time on ambiguities that the authors already resolved.
